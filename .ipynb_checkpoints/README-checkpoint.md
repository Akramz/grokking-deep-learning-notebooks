* Grokking Deep Learning was written to help **give you a foundation in deep learning** so that you can **master a major deep learning framework**.
   * Requires no math background beyond basic arithmetic.
   * Doesn't rely on a high-level library that might hide what's going on.
   * Anyone can read this book and understand how deep learning really works.
   * You won't just read the theory, you'll discover it yourself.
