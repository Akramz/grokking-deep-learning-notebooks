# Notebooks â€” Grokking Deep Learning by Andrew W. Trask

> https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning


<div style="text-align:center"><img style="width:100%" src="static/imgs/Cover.png"></div>

- Grokking Deep Learning was written to help **give you a foundation in deep learning** so that you can **master a major deep learning framework**.
   - Requires no math background beyond basic arithmetic.
   - Doesn't rely on a high-level library that might hide what's going on.
   - Anyone can read this book and understand how deep learning really works.
   - You won't just read the theory, you'll discover it yourself.
> (You can Buy the Book from [Manning Publications](https: //www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Deep-Learning-Andrew-Trask/dp/1617293709)).
